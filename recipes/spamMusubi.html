        <p>Spam musubi is a popular Hawaiian snack. It's typically made with short grain rice and grilled teriyaki-marinated Spam, 
            sprinkled with furikake—a Japanese seaweed seasoning—and wrapped in nori. 
            You'll find many variations on musubi with different fillings, flavorings, 
            and proteins: some even deep fry the whole package. 
            This easy take is a perfect for picnics, beach hangs, or an afternoon snack.
